# openSUSE and Java 8 Runtime image

This project builds an openSUSE-based image which includes the OpenJDK 8 Runtime Environment and is based off the [OpenSUSE Base Image](https://github.com/CAFapi/opensuse-base-image). It can be used as a base image by projects which require Java 8.

### Tini
[Tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini) is pre-installed in the container.  If the image entrypoint is not overwritten then it will be automatically used.

### PostgreSQL Client
[PostgreSQL Client](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html) is pre-installed in the container. psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks.

### Startup Scripts
Any executable scripts added to the `/startup/startup.d/` directory will be automatically run each time the container is started (assuming the image entrypoint is not overwritten).

### Certificate Installation
The image comes pre-installed with several startup scripts which provide a mechanism to extend the CA certificates which should be trusted.
